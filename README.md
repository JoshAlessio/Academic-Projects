The goal of the loan default prediction algorithm is to help banks with the decision making process involved in approving a loan.  Three machine learning algorithms were used to predict the loan defaults:  Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.  I focused most of my energy on the Decision Tree classifier because I like being able to interpret the results by looking at each node in the the tree and tracing the possible outcomes.  The decision tree classifier is a supervised learning algorithm based primarily on the sklearn python library.  In this project I analized, cleaned and transformed the data in order to improve the algorithms accuracy and efficiency.  I used oversampling with the SMOTE function.  One of the challenges of this project was dealing with missing data for some of the key fields from the loan application data file.
